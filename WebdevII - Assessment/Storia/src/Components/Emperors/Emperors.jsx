                    Gaius Julius Caesar was a military general and dictator, not
                    an emperor. He conquered Gaul, reformed the Roman calendar,
                    and played a key role in ending the Roman Republic. He was
                    assassinated on the Ides of March in 44 BCE by conspirators
                    including Brutus. His name became synonymous with power,
                    influencing titles like "Caesar" and "Tsar."

                    Lucius Aurelius Commodus ruled from 180 to 192 CE and was
                    known for his erratic behavior and vanity. He declared
                    himself a reincarnation of Hercules and even participated in
                    gladiatorial games. His reign ended when he was strangled by
                    a wrestler, part of a conspiracy involving his inner circle.
                    Commodus' rule is often seen as a key point in the decline
                    of the Roman Empire.

                    is remembered for his cruelty and eccentricities, including
                    making his horse, Incitatus, a consul. His behavior led to
                    widespread instability, and he was assassinated by members
                    of the Praetorian Guard in a conspiracy. He remains one of
                    the most controversial and chaotic emperors in Roman
                    history.

                    His reign was marked by military conflicts, particularly
                    with Germanic tribes. He is best known for his philosophical
                    writings in Meditations. His choice of his son Commodus as
                    successor is often criticized, as it led to instability
